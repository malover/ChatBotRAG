To this aim, they have proposed and performed similar experiments. First, starting from a given wildtype sequence, they have iterated several rounds of alternating sequence diversification via error-prone polymerase chain reaction (epPCR) (\nCadwell and Joyce 1992\n), and selection for functionality (antibiotic resistance for both experiments).

As a first check of robustness, we show that this landscape represents well the mutational effects of single-residue substitutions when compared with a deep-mutational scanning experiment, and that the inclusion of epistatic couplings in the landscape model is essential for its accuracy.",

If sequence libraries would also be sequenced before and after the selection step, we could establish a better correspondence between statistical energies and selection, up to a gauge of statistical energies vs. antibiotic concentrations.\nHowever, the potential of such evolutionary models in data-driven landscapes goes far beyond the application to experimental evolution. As is shown by SEEC (\nde la Paz et al. 2020\n), already the simplest nontrivial evolutionary model allows for illuminating important consequences of epistasis in evolution, like the site- and time-dependence of substitution rates. We anticipate that the proposed modeling framework may capture many of these effects in a highly quantitative way.",

The transition into university has been highlighted as a key period affecting student outcomes as well as well-being. Early identification of those students at risk may assist the transition for many students moving into higher education. Previous research has identified the Motivation and Engagement Scale – University/College (MES-UC) as a valid instrument for measuring motivation to learn in physiotherapy students. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between a student’s motivation to learn on entry into an undergraduate physiotherapy program and their performance through first year.",

However, clean-up activities on such accumulation regions are limited by the spread of the large-size floating litter on the sea surface. Data gathered by a small-scale fishing vessel devoted to active fishing for floating litter activities during the spring and summer of 2018 reveals that the linear streaks of high concentration of floating litter (so-called litter “windrows”) are common accumulation structures in the south-east coast of the Bay of Biscay. The random search of litter windrows for their collection through surface tows of macro-nets was proved to be an effective action for floating litter mitigation. A total of 196 tows collected 16.2 tons of floating marine litter in 68 working days.",

A total of 196 tows collected 16.2 tons of floating marine litter in 68 working days. Most of the litter windrows were around 1 km length and, on average, accumulated 77.75 kg of floating marine litter. Fishing, shipping and aquaculture sectors were the source of 35% of the 4,130 litter items analyzed (55% in weight of the sourced items), and plastic was the most common type of material (96% in terms of items). A better understanding of the phenomenon of the litter windrows, capable to guide clean-up efforts in space and time, would provide a considerable improvement in the efficiency of mitigation actions to reduce the marine litter pollution.

    "text": "marine litter pollution. The observations of litter windrows in the coastal area of the south-east of the Bay of Biscay demonstrate the key role of submesoscale processes in the distribution of FML. The present work provides a thorough description of floating litter windrows in nature, which it was non-existent to date. The results are the kind of proof necessary to boost the research addressed on the submesoscale aggregations of FML. Coupling litter windrows observations with remote-sensing technology and high-resolution modeling techniques offer great opportunities for the mitigation actions against marine litter.\nAbout half of the floating marine litter (FML) in the world is thought to be confined in great accumulation zones or hot spots (\n).

Besides, regional models point to the importance of FML accumulation zones in the coastal waters of the south east Bay of Biscay (SE Bay of Biscay) caused by the combination of relatively long residence times ant the litter influx from both local and remote areas (\n).

(2011)\nA more effective mitigation strategy addressed on the presence of litter windrows at the coastal area requires further background information about spatial distribution, frequency, persistence or origin of these small-scale ocean processes.",

This first descriptive study provides, with unprecedent detail, an observational description of litter windrows in the coastal waters of the SE Bay of Biscay. Litter windrows were usually rectilinear. Longer and less dense windrows may appear in summer. Besides, they often formed further from the coastline during this season. The common findings of small-scale convergence structures in the coastal waters of the SE Bay of Biscay provide, for the first time, enough evidence to support an active fishing for FML. The lack of previous studies of litter windrows does not enable comparisons with other periods or regions. This experience supports the efficacy of the FML mitigation actions carried by the fishing sector in Bay of Biscay, although preventive measurements should be necessarily conducted at the same time.",

The apple fruit moth, Argyresthia conjugella (Lepidoptera, Yponomeutidae), is a pre-dispersal seed predator. Larvae feed on rowanberries ( Sorbus aucuparia ), and when rowanberry seed production is low (i.e., inter-masting), the moth switches from laying eggs in rowanberries to apples ( Malus domestica ), resulting in devastating losses in apple crops. Using genetic methods, we investigated if this small moth expresses any local genetic structure, or alternatively if gene flow may be high within the Scandinavian Peninsula (~850.000 km 2 , 55 o - 69 o N). Genetic diversity was found to be high (n = 669, mean He = 0.71).",

Genetic diversity was found to be high (n = 669, mean He = 0.71). For three out of ten tetranucleotide STRs, we detected heterozygote deficiency caused by null alleles, but tests showed little impact on the overall results. Genetic differentiation between the 28 sampling locations was very low (average FST = 0.016, P < 0.000). Surprisingly, we found that all individuals could be assigned to one of two non-geographic genetic clusters, and that a third, geographic cluster was found to be associated with 30% of the sampling locations, with weak but significant signals of isolation-by-distance. Conclusively, our findings suggest wind-aided dispersal and spatial synchrony of both sexes of the apple fruit moth over large areas and across very different climatic zones.",

The apple fruit moth,\nArgyresthia conjugella\n(Lepidoptera, Yponomeutidae), is a pre-dispersal seed predator. Larvae feed on rowanberries (\n), and when rowanberry seed production is low (i.e., inter-masting), the moth switches from laying eggs in rowanberries to apples (\n), resulting in devastating losses in apple crops. Using genetic methods, we investigated if this small moth expresses any local genetic structure, or alternatively if gene flow may be high within the Scandinavian Peninsula (~850.000 km\nN). Genetic diversity was found to be high (n = 669, mean He = 0.71). For three out of ten tetranucleotide STRs, we detected heterozygote deficiency caused by null alleles, but tests showed little impact on the overall results. Genetic differentiation between the 28 sampling locations was very low (average FST = 0.016, P < 0.000).",

This lead to overall homogenization of the gene pool over time as the growth phase progresses [\n]. Generally, genetic diversity at panmixia is expected to be higher if the Moran effect is the main driver of spatial-temporal patterns. This is because genetic diversity originates from several source populations, whereas under the epicenter hypothesis, genetic diversity should generally be lower because one main source population is involved, and edge populations should display particularly low genetic diversity because of repeated bottlenecks along the way. In the current study, high genetic diversity was found across the study area with low genetic differentiation patterns, signs of recent bottlenecks were absent, and relatedness was low within sites.",

Coupled with the results of a previous study where strong spatial genetic differentiation was found at comparatively small geographical scales [\n], this suggests a strong Moran effect. However, a significant isolation-by-distance pattern is expected under the epicenter hypothesis because genetic variation will change gradually with distance from the source population. We found a weak but significant isolation-by-distance pattern and high migration rates. Isolation-by-distance tests have been shown to result in weak patterns in the presence of populations that are located at the edges of the metapopulation [\n]. This is because these populations will receive different dispersers from more central populations.",

In the present study, a high number of coastal populations in Scandinavia are likely situated at the edge of the distribution range (i.e., there are no populations further west or north of the current sampling locations). Therefore, this phenomenon might have contributed to the weak isolation-by-distance pattern found.\nTherefore, we are currently unable to fully distinguish between these two hypotheses and cannot exclude the possibility that a mixed effect is present in the apple fruit moth.

Hence, future studies with a temporal sampling design are needed to further corroborate these initial findings. Our results further suggest that 2012 (i.e., the collection year of the 2016 study [\n]) was a period with small population sizes and therefore, in a crash phase, whereas 2016 (i.e., the collection year of the current study) appears to have been (close to) the peak phase of the outbreak. Indeed, this is suggested by the number of rowan berries found in West and East Norway over time (\n). In 2012, there were few rowan berries, while in 2016, rowan berries were far more abundant. This indicates that apple fruit moth populations were in a growth phase in 2016, suggesting that an interval of maximum four years is necessary to complete an outbreak cycle. This is consistent with previous results showing that rowanberry masting occurred every 2–4 years [\n].",
